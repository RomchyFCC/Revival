# Revival
Going full time


So in this project i relearned about HTML and CSS.

The code is clumped up and unorginized, i might come around to fixing that some time later but right now there are more important things to do.

I just wanted a file where i use most popular stuff provided by html and css.

Anyone is welcome to leave a comment on how they would make it better.

#### All who contribute will be writen here and in the comment of the file they made better.
